At Pocket, we’re always working hard to deliver a stellar experience when reading content on any device. This is why we’re thrilled to introduce the Pocket Instant App for Android. Now, with the simple tap of a link, readers can instantly experience the benefits of Pocket, even if they don’t have the app installed on their phone.

Our Instant App includes two of Pocket’s best features, Article View and Related Recommendations, giving readers a seamless introduction into what can be unlocked by downloading our full app and signing up for a Pocket account.

**Here’s how it works:**

Normally on Android, tapping links shared from Pocket will open in your mobile browser. Depending on your Internet connection and the size of the article, it can be a long wait for the article to finish loading.

Now, when you open a link shared from Pocket, it will load in our Instant App for Android. The app loads quickly (they don’t call them “instant” for nothing!), and you can turn on Article View for a clean, focused, and distraction-free reading experience. Want to dive deeper? Tap the bottom of your screen to see a few recommendations related to the article that was shared. The best part is, this rich experience is delivered to you without needing to install the full Pocket app.
