iMessage apps are a fun and useful way to interact with your friends and family without ever leaving the Messages app. Now, with Pocket for iMessage, you can browse and search your saved items in Pocket and seamlessly share them without ever leaving the conversation.

**Here’s how it works:**

First, open an existing conversation or start a new one and add a recipient. Then, tap the Apps button and select Pocket.

(If you can’t find Pocket, you may need to enable the app first. Just open the iMessage App Store, then open the Manage tab, and enable Pocket. Here’s a helpful article from Apple explaining how this works: [Use iMessage Apps on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206906))

Once you’ve opened Pocket, you can scroll through your recent Pocket activity. Both newly saved items and Archived items will appear here. You can also use the Search box to search your Pocket account to find the article you’d like to share.

Tip: Tap the ⌃ button in the bottom right corner of the app to expand iMessage for easier browsing.

Finally, simply tap the item that you’d like to share, and it’ll be ready to share. The article title and preview image will load automatically in the message box, and you’ll have the option to add a comment or simply send it off!
