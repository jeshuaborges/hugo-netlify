A lot can change in a year. Last December, we had a different name (Read It Later), and the service, founded in 2007, had welcomed its 4 millionth user.

A year later, we’ve settled in with our new name (Pocket!), we have a community that has nearly doubled in size—and as the chart below demonstrates, activity has taken off, inside Pocket and across our developer community.

All told, you “saved to Pocket” 240 million times from January through December, more than the prior four years combined.

### **What’s Popular in Pocket**

Your most-saved article this year? [“Obama’s Way,”](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama) Michael Lewis’s 13,000-word presidential portrait for Vanity Fair. Its popularity demonstrated the power of save-for-later when it comes to empowering people to embrace longform reading. In fact, 80 percent of all “opens” in Pocket happened after the story’s initial four-day rush of popularity—and for every one person who read “Obama’s Way” in Pocket, they introduced the article to an average of 1.4 others outside of Pocket.

The most-saved video in Pocket was (surprise!) PSY’s [“Gangnam Style.”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) The music video remained within 50% of its peak popularity in Pocket for a whopping 58 days, and the graphic below shows that it truly was a viral phenomenon. The video didn’t even peak in Pocket until 70 days after it was first posted.

### **Thank You**

As the holidays approach, we just wanted to say thank you for an incredible year. You helped turn Pocket into a chart-topping (and award-winning) app for iPhone, iPad, Android and Mac, and your feedback has helped us make Pocket a simple, enjoyable way to save and view the content that matters to you.

**Here’s one more data point we’re really proud of**: Pocket released more than 40 updates this year across iOS, Android, Mac and beyond.

We’re excited for what’s next in 2013. Happy holidays from the entire Pocket team.
