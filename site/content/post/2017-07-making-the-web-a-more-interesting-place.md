Breaking news alerts. Medium posts. 42 cat gifs that perfectly describe your life. Everyday, thousands of new stories are published, burying what came before them, and leaving it to you to scroll through the clutter to simply find what is good.

Yet everyday, millions of people on Pocket are saving and reading what’s interesting to them – helping us build an impressive library of over 3 billion saves that surfaces a unique and truly human view of what’s good on the web.

Having this kind of insight empowers us to create experiences that remove the work and stress of finding something interesting to read or watch, so that you can simply focus on the stories that are worthy of both your time and attention.

Today, we are excited to introduce not one, not two, but three new experiences and features that will help you do just that.

### **Browse, search, and explore the very best of the web**

For the first time, we are opening up Pocket’s understanding of what’s good and worthwhile on the Internet, and making it easy for anyone to search and discover the best of the best on any topic. No Pocket account necessary.
